# NHL DRAFT ANALYSIS

This is the repo for my blog post on NHL Draft Analysis.  

Note on data: See  
https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2000_entry.html  
http://www.hockeyabstract.com/testimonials/nhlplayerdata1967-2013  
for access to the data I used.  

Note on SQL:  
Originally, I wanted to build a MySQL database, and I populated it, but soon after realized I would need to include all of the data, and in the name of speed I gave up the dream of adding it all to a database and just pulled data directly from the source for the most part.  

Notebooks:  
If you, too, want to populate your own MySQL database, you can use the load_db Notebook.  
Otherwise, the three analysis notebooks each cover a different piece of the analysis.  
Analysis - Checks out the rosters of stanley cup finalists  
draft_analysis - Analysis relating to probabilities for draft picks and teams  
Turnover_Analysis - Analysing general player turnover
